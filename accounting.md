Accounting

You may think why is accounts important in my business? If I am a sole person who is handling my shoe business then I don’t have to really keep a tab on expenses and stuff. But that’s not true. Account isn’t only about income and expenses. It gives you the record of all the things you’ve spent on or maybe you still need to be paid for. This hence, at the end of the day gives you an idea where your business stands.

Accounting is very much used in our daily lives in a way. Because in a way we all plan what we’ll do with our money, how much will be spent and how much will be kept back. All this is called budgeting. So with budgeting you can basically spend you money cautiously. This is important when you run any business too. You need to keep a tab about are you inflows and outflows of all the economic resources use in your business.
Thus accounting forms a very crucial part in any business to help make good economic decisions with the information it provides.

After being a little familiar with why we need accounting lets get familiar with what is accounting? In simple words it’s basically a record of all the financial transactions for an asset or individual, such as at a bank (when you update your pass book you can view all the financial transactions you’ve made), a credit card company or a retail store. This is the way my professor thought me in college. But its true don’t worry. Taking our shoe business into picture it generally keeps a record of all the payments between the seller and the buyer.

According to Wikipedia, if you want a more trustable definition of what account is.

   "accounts-accounting is a systematic way to record transactions. An account (book keeping) refers to assets,liabilities, income, expense and equity as represented by individual ledger pages, to which changes in value are chronologically recorded with debit and credit entries. These entries, refered to as postings, become part of a book of final entry or ledger, examples of cmmn financial account sare cash, sales,wages and payroll. A chart of accounts provides a listing of all finacial accounts used by particular business ,organization or goverment agency."













With the knowledge of what accounting is all about the next step would be to know what basic accounting includes. Like if you see in the above definition how is book keeping done and what is the meaning of assets, liabilities etc.?  There are three main financial statements which one needs to know about and its purpose. They are 1) income statement 2) balance sheet 3) statement of cash inflows. As we go further I will explain all the terms and their purpose in accounting.

Income statement will show how profitable your shoe business has been during the time interval shown in the statement's heading. This period of time might be a week, a month, three months, five weeks, or a year—you can choose whatever time period you feel is most useful. The reporting of profitability involves two things: the amount that was earned (revenues) and the expenses necessary to earn the revenues. As you will see next, the term revenues is not the same as receipts, and the term expenses involves more than just writing a check to pay a bill.

The main revenues for you shoe business are the fees it earns for delivering shoes to your clients. Revenues are recorded when they are earned, not when the company receives the money. For e.g. say I deliver about 10 pairs of shoes to my client in pune during the month of April at a rate of 3000 Rs. Per shoes, then technically I’ve earned  a total of Rs. 30,000 for that month. Then if I send an invoice to my client for this fees and I’ve specified in my terms and conditions that my client should pay by May 10. Even though my client doesn’t pay till May 10 the accrual basis of accounting requires that Rs.30000 be recorded as April revenue, since that is when the delivery work actually took place. . After expenses are matched with these revenues, the income statement for December will show just how profitable the company was in delivering parcels in December.

The second part of an income statement is the expense. Almost similar like entering revenues in April though your client pays you in May on similar lines consider while you are delivering those 10 pairs to your client in pune you fall ill and you can’t go till there. So you appoint a worker to deliver these shoes to your client and you pay him say 1500 Rs. For this work. You pay him in May but he has delivered the shoes in April so the expense needs to be shown in the April income statement. The actual date that the rs.1500 is paid out doesn't matter—what matters is when the work was done—when the expense was incurred—and in this case, the work was done in April.

Definition of expense

Expense-an expense is an outflow of money to another person or group to pay for an item or service, or for a category of costs. For a tenant, rent is an expense, for students or parents,tution is an expense,. An expense is a cost that is “paid” or “remitted”, usually in exchange for something  of value. In accounting, expense is an outflow of cash or other valuable asstes from a person or a company to another person or company. Technically an expense is an event in which an aset is used up r liability is incurred.











An income statement, does not report the cash coming in—rather, its purpose is to (1) report the revenues earned by the company's efforts during the period, and (2) report the expenses incurred by the company during the same period. The purpose of the income statement is to show a company's profitability during a specific period of time. 

Income- its the consumption and savings oppurtunity gained by an entity witin a specified time frame which is generaly  expressed in monetary terms. For individuals , income is the sum of all the wages, salaries, profits, interests payments, rents and other firms of earnings received in a given period of time for firms, income generally refers to net-profit:what remains of revenue after expenses  have been subtracted.





Let’s move on to next financial statement which is balance sheet. Balance Sheet is the snap shot of financial strength of any company at any point of time. It gives the details of the assets and the liabilities of the company. Understanding balance sheet is very important because it gives an idea of the financial strength of the company at any given point of time. While the income statement recaps three months' worth of operations, the balance sheet is a snapshot of what the company's finances look like only on the last day of the quarter.


Definition from wiki

balance sheet- in financial accounting, a balance sheet or statement of financial position is a summary of the financial balances of a sole proprietorship, a business proprietorship or a company. Assets ,liabilities and ownership equity are listed as or a specific date,such as the end of its financial condition.  A balance sheet basically summarizes an organization or individuals asstes, equity and liablities at a specific point in time. Individuals and small businesses tend to have simple balance sheets.










If the balance sheet for our shoe business is dated 30th April then, the amounts shown on the balance sheet are the balances in the accounts after all transactions pertaining to December 31 have been recorded. If you read the definition given above carefully you’ll come across terms like assets, liabilities etc. so lets have a detailed look at what it means.

Assets are things that a company owns and are sometimes referred to as the resources of the company. I think the first thing that may pop in your head when you think about assets is something like cash in your bank or maybe company’s vehicle, all the supplies in hand etc. well your absolutely right and these are reported in accounts called Cash, Vehicles, and Supplies resp.


Time for the actual definition from wiki

Assets- in financial accounting, assets are economic resources. Anything tangible or intangible that is capable of being owned or controlled  to produce value and that is held to have positive economic value is considered and asset.simply stated, asstes represent ownership of value that can be converted into cash(although cash itself is considered as an asset). In our business shoes, bankacount and customer is an asset.









But let me mention something important that is a part of assets too before I forget. One asset that you might not consider is Accounts Receivable. We have come across a situation like this before but you must have not realized it earlier. The one where you’ve appointed somebody to deliver you 10 pairs to Pune but you customer hasn’t paid till 10th May 12, 2011, the amount owed to your business is an asset known as Accounts Receivable. There’s a lot that goes into assets but that would be getting into the nitty gritty of accounts. This is not my work to do. Just kidding. 

The next important part of a balance sheet is liabilities. Like assets, liabilities of you company is as of the date noted in your balance sheet. Liabilities are obligations of the company; they are amounts owed to others as of the balance sheet date. For  some examples of liabilities: the amount you owe to the supply store for items(shoes) purchased on credit (Accounts Payable), the wages you owe an employee but haven’t yet paid him (Wages Payable).


Another liability is money received in advance of actually earning the money. For example, suppose that you enter into an agreement with one of your customers stipulating that the customer prepays rs.500 in return for the delivery of every parcel. So if your customer wants 5 pairs of shoes delivered at her place then she has to pay Rs. 2500. Assume you receive that 2500 payment on May 1 for deliveries to be made between may1 and May 31. You have a cash receipt of 2500 on December 1, but you not have revenues of 2500 at this point. You will have revenues only when you earn them by delivering the parcels. On May 1, you will show that your asset Cash increased by 2500, but you will also have to show that you have a liability of 2500. (The liability to deliver the shoes within a month, or return the money).



.
Wiki time 

Liabilities- its defined as an obligation of an entity arising from past transactions or events, the settlement of which may result in the transfer or use of assets , provision of services or other yielding of economic benefits in the furture. A liability is defined by the following characteristics:
	1)	any type of borrowing from persons or banks for improving a business or personal income that is payable during short or long time.
	2)	A duty or responsibility to others that entails settlement by future transfer or use of assets,provision of services or other transaction yielding an economic benefit, at a specified or determinable date, on occurence if a specified event, or on demand.
	3)	A duty or resposiblity that obligates the entity to another, leaving it little or no discretion to avoid sttlement and
	4)	a transaction or event obligating the entity that has already occured. 
Example of liabiilities are all kinds of payable- accounts payable, sales payable interests payable etc.




















The last section in liability is stockholders equity. It’s just something I would like to cover since it’s a part of liabilities. If the company is a corporation, the third section of a corporation's balance sheet is Stockholders' Equity. (If the company is a sole proprietorship, it is referred to as Owner's Equity.) The amount of Stockholders' Equity is exactly the difference between the asset amounts and the liability amounts. As a result accountants often refer to Stockholders' Equity as the difference (or residual) of assets minus liabilities. Stockholders' Equity is also the "book value" of the corporation. Revenues will automatically cause an increase in Stockholders' Equity and expenses will automatically cause a decrease in Stockholders' Equity. This illustrates a link between a company's balance sheet and income statement.


The third financial statement that you need to understand is the statement of cash flows. This statement shows how your cash amount has changed during the time interval shown in the heading of the statement. You will be able to see at a glance the cash generated and used by your company's operating activities, its investing activities, and its financing activities. Much of the information on this financial statement will come from your company’s balance sheets and income statements.


To begin the process of setting up your shoe business its high time we give it a name na, lets say (Citywalk Center Inc.) accounting system, you will need to make a detailed listing of all the names of the accounts that Citywalk Center Inc. might find useful for reporting transactions. This detailed listing is referred to as a chart of accounts. The list of some sample accounts that you will probably need to include on your chart of accounts:


Balance Sheet accounts:
Asset accounts (Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Supplies, Equipment)
Liability accounts (Examples:  Accounts Payable, Wages Payable)
Stockholders' Equity accounts (Examples: Common Stock)



The next basic accounting concept: the double entry system requires that the same Rs. amount of the transaction must be entered on both the left side of one account, and on the right side of another account. Instead of the word left, accountants use the word debit; and instead of the word right, accountants use the word credit. You may ask me how you will know which accounts should be debited and which should be credited. There’s a simple way of remembering this thing. ( this is how I learnt my accounts from this website accounting coaching). There’s a simple equation assets = liabilities + stockholders equity.

Just as assets are on the left side (or debit side) of the accounting equation, the asset accounts in the general ledger have their balances on the left side. To increase an asset account's balance, you put more on the left side of the asset account. In accounting jargon, you debit the asset account. To decrease an asset account balance you credit the account, that is, you enter the amount on the right side.

Just as liabilities and stockholders' equity are on the right side (or credit side) of the accounting equation, the liability and equity accounts in the general ledger have their balances on the right side. To increase the balance in a liability or stockholders' equity account, you put more on the right side of the account. In accounting jargon, you credit the liability or the equity account. To decrease a liability or equity, you debit the account, that is, you enter the amount on the left side of the account. There are exceptions though.

Since many transactions involve cash, if Catwalk center receives cash, the Cash account is debited; when Catwalk Center pays cash, the Cash account is credited.


Let’s give you some examples of simple transactions


Now consider right from the start thats when you first start your business. To start with your shoe business you first need to have some initial amount of money. Say you have put in Rs. 1,00,000. But this is provided by your father. Though there is cash in your business your father is a shareholder of your company. So the cask will be your asset and since you father has provided it to you. Hell be your liability. Maybe later you decide to pay him the money with interest. But as of now here is how your balance sheet will look like

Balance sheet 
April 1st 2011
Assets                                                                             Liabilities & Stockholders' Equity                          
   cash                    Rs.1,00,000                                      Liabilities
                                                                                       Stockholders equity                        Rs.1,00,000
                                                                                                                                         
Total Assets           Rs. 1,00,000                                         Total Liab. & Stockholders' Equity  Rs.1,00,000




Now you can see that the balance sheet is in balance. The total on the left side that’s the asset side is equal to that on the right side that is the credit side. So if you put it in the equation assets=liabilities + stockholders equity then you will get 1,00,000 = 0 + 1,00,000. The accounting equation and the balance sheet should always be in balance.

So youve got your initial money to run your business you need to get your shoes from somewhere. Say you have a supplier that provides you with all the shoes that u wanna sell.so you purchase your shoes from this supplier. (let’s say you buy around 20 pairs of shoes for the price of 10,000 Rs.. The shoes that you buy becomes your raw material which is an asset. Cause your gonna make some money from it. And your supplier becomes a liability.Since you have to pay the amount for all the things youve purchased from him.so when you buy somethin from him it becmes your expense since you need to pay for those shoes.

So since you’ve purchased the shoes from your supplier it is an asset but you’ve paid for it. So cash will be credited.


Cash a/c



Account name                                                     debit                            credit
         Shoes                                                        Rs.10,000

         Cash                                                                                               Rs. 10,000




Keeping the above balance sheet in picture. Your balance sheet will now look like this


Catwalk City
Balance sheet 
April 1st 2011
Assets                                                                             Liabilities & Stockholders' Equity                          
  Cash                 Rs.90,000

 shoes                 Rs.10,000                                            Stockholders equity                        Rs.1,00,000

Total Assets        Rs.1,00,000                                         Total Liab. & Stockholders' Equity  Rs.1,00,000





Now you’ve got your shoes from your supplier and your first customer calls you up and asks you to deliver 10 pairs of shoes she saw the other day at your place(since your working from home). The total bill is around 12,000 bucks. After delivering it to her place she pays the amount only in May 1, 2011 after you’ve discussed it with her obviously. But since the delivery is already done in April you have to enter the details in your April balance sheet.

So Rs. 12,000 is the revenue you’ve earned so that will be credited and in accounts receivable the amount will be debited.





Account name                                                              debit                            credit
    Account Receivable                                                 Rs.12,000

    Service Revenue                                                                                              Rs. 12,000





Similarly consider you are purchasing shoes from your supplier.considering the above example. What happens to your balancesheet then?.  Say youve ordered for a supply of 20 pairs of shoes at the rate of Rs.10,000. He has delivered the shoes but you don’t pay him until May 13, 2011. This amount is amount payable. If a company does not pay cash immediately, you cannot credit Cash. But because the company owes someone the money for its purchase, we say it has an obligation or liability to pay. Most accounts involved with obligations have the word "payable" in their name, and one of the most frequently used accounts is Accounts Payable. Also keep in mind that expenses are almost always debited.



Account name                                                              debit                            credit
    shoes                                                                        Rs.10,000

    sales                                                                                                             Rs. 10,000


 

The final balance sheet looks like this
